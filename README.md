### ðŸ§¾ Project Summary:

Cleaned and standardized two messy financial datasets containing customer profiles and transaction histories. This project focused exclusively on data cleaning and transformation, ensure data accuracy and consistency.

#### Key tasks included:

- Stripping whitespace and normalizing column names

- Handling duplicate customer and transaction records

- Cleaning phone numbers and monetary fields of special characters

- Filling missing values with appropriate substitutes (e.g., â€˜Unknownâ€™, 0, or median age by group)
- Standardizing data types, especially for dates and numeric fields

- Merging customer profiles with transaction data into a unified, analysis-ready file

The final cleaned dataset was exported to Excel for use in analytics, dashboards, or further automation workflows.
